Tired of freezing in the cold waiting for a bus that's late?  This app
will let you stay warm inside until your bus is near.  It displays the
locations and estimated arrival times of Ottawa buses using GPS data
supplied by OC Transpo.

To begin, search for a stop by number or name, or choose one from the
map.  Then choose the bus route you're interested in, and you'll see
data for the next three arrivals at that stop.  You can refresh the
results at any time to stay up to date.  Tapping on a bus will bring
up more information about it.

This is an open source project release under the GPL.  Source code is
available at https://github.com/argilo/BusFollower.  Contributions are
welcome!
